Nextjs App to test my skills at styling a web app from just looking at it. I love the Sports Basement store and decided to replicate their home page, and included the first portion of their shop page. 

I used TailwindCSS to style the app, and took the opportunity to practice using flex box and grid options while working with the the different 'sale' or 'field-guide' sections on the app.
